# tf-mod-aws-s3

## Module description


This module creates an S3 bucket with support of versioning, encryption, ACL and bucket object policy.




Project: **[%!s(<nil>)](%!s(<nil>))** : [[%!s(<nil>)](%!s(<nil>))] | [[%!s(<nil>)](%!s(<nil>))] 




## Introduction

These features of S3 bucket configurations are supported:
- static web-site hosting
- access logging
- versioning
- CORS
- lifecycle rules
- s3 upload bucket policy for identity deploying the module
- server-side encryption
- object locking
- Cross-Region Replication (CRR)
- ELB log delivery bucket policy



## Usage

**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/https://github.com/Callumccr/tf-mod-aws-s3/releases).


The below values shown in the usage of this module are purely representative, please replace desired values as required.

| aws | ~> 2.0 >= 2.7.0 |

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:-----:|
| acceleration\_status | (Optional) - Sets the accelerate configuration of an existing bucket. Can be Enabled or Suspended. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| bucket\_name | (Optional, Forces new resource) - The name of the bucket. If omitted, Terraform will assign a random, unique name. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| bucket\_prefix | (Optional, Forces new resource) - Creates a unique bucket name beginning with the specified prefix. Conflicts with bucket. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| policy | (Optional) - A valid bucket policy JSON document. Note that if the policy document is not specific enough (but still valid), Terraform may view the policy as constantly changing in a terraform plan. In this case, please make sure you use the verbose/specific version of the policy. For more information about building AWS IAM policy documents with Terraform, see the AWS IAM Policy Document Guide. | `string` | n/a | yes |

| request\_payer | (Optional) - Specifies who should bear the cost of Amazon S3 data transfer. Can be either BucketOwner or Requester. By default, the owner of the S3 bucket would incur the costs of any data transfer. See Requester Pays Buckets developer guide for more information. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| acl | (Optional) - The canned ACL to apply. Defaults to 'private'. | `string` | `"private"` | no |

| attach\_elb\_log\_delivery\_policy | (Optional) - Controls if S3 bucket should have ELB log delivery policy attached | `bool` | `false` | no |
| attach\_policy | (Optional) - Controls if S3 bucket should have bucket policy attached (set to `true` to use value of `policy` as bucket policy) | `bool` | `false` | no |
| attributes | (Optional) - Additional attributes (e.g. `1`) | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| aws\_account\_id | The AWS account id of the provider being deployed to (e.g. 12345678). Autoloaded from account.tfvars | `string` | `""` | no |
| aws\_assume\_role\_arn | (Optional) - ARN of the IAM role when optionally connecting to AWS via assumed role. Autoloaded from account.tfvars. | `string` | `""` | no |
| aws\_assume\_role\_external\_id | (Optional) - The external ID to use when making the AssumeRole call. | `string` | `""` | no |
| aws\_assume\_role\_session\_name | (Optional) - The session name to use when making the AssumeRole call. | `string` | `""` | no |
| aws\_region | The AWS region (e.g. ap-southeast-2). Autoloaded from region.tfvars. | `string` | `""` | no |
| block\_public\_acls | (Optional) - Whether Amazon S3 should block public ACLs for this bucket. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| block\_public\_policy | (Optional) - Whether Amazon S3 should block public bucket policies for this bucket. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| cors\_rule | (Optional) - Map containing a rule of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. | `map` | `{}` | no |
| delimiter | (Optional) - Delimiter to be used between `namespace`, `environment`, `stage`, `name` and `attributes` | `string` | `"-"` | no |
| enabled | (Optional) - A Switch that decides whether to create a terraform resource or run a provisioner. Default is true | `bool` | `true` | no |
| environment | (Optional) - Environment, e.g. 'dev', 'qa', 'staging', 'prod' | `string` | `""` | no |
| force\_destroy | (Optional, Default:false ) - A boolean that indicates all objects should be deleted from the bucket so that the bucket can be destroyed without error. These objects are not recoverable. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| ignore\_public\_acls | (Optional) - Whether Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs for this bucket. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| lifecycle\_rule | (Optional) - List of maps containing configuration of object lifecycle management. | `list` | `[]` | no |
| logging | (Optional) - Map containing access bucket logging configuration. | `map(string)` | `{}` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| bucket\_arn | The ARN of the bucket. Will be of format arn:aws:s3:::bucketname. |
| bucket\_domain\_name | The bucket domain name. Will be of format bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com. |
| bucket\_hosted\_zone\_id | The Route 53 Hosted Zone ID for this bucket's region. |
| bucket\_id | The name of the bucket. |
| bucket\_objects\_etag | The domain of the website endpoint, if the bucket is configured with a website. If not, this will be an empty string. This is used to create Route 53 alias records. |
| bucket\_region | The AWS region this bucket resides in. |
| bucket\_regional\_domain\_name | The bucket region-specific domain name. The bucket domain name including the region name, please refer here for format. Note: The AWS CloudFront allows specifying S3 region-specific endpoint when creating S3 origin, it will prevent redirect issues from CloudFront to S3 Origin URL. |
| bucket\_website\_domain | The domain of the website endpoint, if the bucket is configured with a website. If not, this will be an empty string. This is used to create Route 53 alias records. |
| bucket\_website\_endpoint | The website endpoint, if the bucket is configured with a website. If not, this will be an empty string. |
